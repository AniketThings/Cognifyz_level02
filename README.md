This repository contains the Power BI dashboard and associated data for analyzing restaurant ratings, popularity, and cuisine combinations. The project involves visualizing various aspects of restaurant data to gain insights into ratings, trends, and geographical patterns.

## Project Overview

The dashboard focuses on analyzing the following key aspects of restaurant data:

1. **Distribution of Aggregate Ratings:**
   - Analyzed the distribution of restaurant ratings to determine the most common rating ranges.

2. **Average Number of Votes:**
   - Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.

3. **Most Common Cuisine Combinations:**
   - Identified the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset.

4. **Cuisine Ratings Analysis:**
   - Analyzed whether certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

5. **Restaurant Locations:**
   - Plotted the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates to identify patterns or clusters in specific areas.

6. **Restaurant Chains:**
   - Identified any restaurant chains present in the dataset and analyzed their ratings and popularity.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI:** Used for building interactive dashboards and performing data analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes restaurant details such as ratings, votes, cuisines, and location coordinates. The dataset is not included in this repository for privacy reasons, but it can be uploaded and connected to Power BI for full analysis.

## Key Visualizations

- **Distribution of Ratings:** A bar or histogram chart to show the frequency of different rating ranges.
- **Average Votes:** A KPI card to show the average number of votes.
- **Cuisine Combinations:** A treemap or a bar chart to highlight the most common combinations of cuisines.
- **Restaurant Locations on Map:** A map visual displaying the locations of restaurants with longitude and latitude.
- **Restaurant Chains:** A bar chart or table to display ratings and popularity across different chains.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the Power BI report file (.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Connect your dataset (if necessary) to the report.
4. Interact with the dashboard to explore the insights.
